So naturally, I thought it would be interesting to create an application in React and have it connect to Liferay DXP and make it available within the Liferay user-interface.</p>\n<p>In this project, we will take a look at:</p>\n<ol>\n<li> Liferay Yeoman generator </li>\n<li> Building a Liferay React JS Widget </li>\n<li> Deploying a React app to Liferay </li>\n<li> Using Liferay UI events </li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Installation</h3>\nLet's install the Yeoman generators for Liferay.  If you are not familiar with Yeoman check it out [Yeoman](https://yeoman.io/), it's a scaffolding tool for modern web apps.  Next, navigate to the Liferay Help Pages and install the [JS Generator](https://help.liferay.com/hc/en-us/articles/360029147411-Installing-the-JS-Generator-and-Generating-a-Bundle)\n<h3>First project</h3>\nTo begin, create a project with the generator with any name you like.  This name will be how the application is recognized in the Liferay user-interface as well, so choose wisely.","frontmatter":{"title":"Build React Apps for Liferay DXP"}}},"pageContext":{"pathSlug":"/building-react-apps-for-liferay","prev":{"frontmatter":{"path":"/react-aws-amplify","title":"React with AWS Amplify","subtitle":"Getting started with React and AWS Amplify"}},"next":null}}}
