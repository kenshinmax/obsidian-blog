Of course, you could create logic within React to make API calls, but then you would have to maintain this over time.</p>\n<p>As an alternative, you could leverage a platform like Liferay DXP, which is an enterprise PaaS solution, as an integration hub.  In this scenario, all of the integration logic would be managed at the platform level that is already integrated with SSO for security, appliying the proper roles and permissions per user.  This includes personalized interactions, like targeted content, access to sites, etc.</p>\n<p>In this article, we will take a look at how easy it is to incorporate a React App into Liferay DXP (Digital Experience Platform) and make it available to end users.</p>\n<p>First, let's use the Liferay Yeoman Generator to create a React Project.</p>\n<h3>Installation</h3>\n<p>Let's install the Yeoman generators for Liferay.  If you are not familiar with Yeoman check it out <a href=\"https://yeoman.io/\">Yeoman</a>, it's a scaffolding tool for modern web apps.  Next, navigate to the Liferay Help Pages and install the <a href=\"https://help.liferay.com/hc/en-us/articles/360029147411-Installing-the-JS-Generator-and-Generating-a-Bundle\">JS Generator</a></p>\n<h3>First project</h3>\n<p>To begin, create a project with the generator with any name you like.  This name will be how the application is recognized in the Liferay user-interface as well, so choose wisely.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Build React Apps for Liferay DXP","featuredImage":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","aspectRatio":1.8867924528301887,"src":"/static/b26b8cc4beaacef97e394c537eec4752/14b42/og-react.jpg","srcSet":"/static/b26b8cc4beaacef97e394c537eec4752/f836f/og-react.jpg 200w,\n/static/b26b8cc4beaacef97e394c537eec4752/2244e/og-react.jpg 400w,\n/static/b26b8cc4beaacef97e394c537eec4752/14b42/og-react.jpg 800w,\n/static/b26b8cc4beaacef97e394c537eec4752/47498/og-react.jpg 1200w","sizes":"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px"}}}}}},"pageContext":{"pathSlug":"/building-react-apps-for-liferay","prev":{"frontmatter":{"path":"/react-aws-amplify","title":"React with AWS Amplify","subtitle":"Getting started with React and AWS Amplify"}},"next":{"frontmatter":{"path":"/graphql-liferay-74-preview","title":"GraphQL Liferay 7.4 Preview","subtitle":"First Look at working with GraphQL Liferay 7.4"}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["3000541721"]}
