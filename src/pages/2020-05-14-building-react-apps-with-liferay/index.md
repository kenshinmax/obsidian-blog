### Building React Apps with Liferay DXP
  For sometime now, I have been facinated with modern Javascript frameworks, especially React.

  More recently, I have been working with Liferay DXP (Digital Experience Platform) that is an enterprise PaaS (Platform as a Service).  So naturally, I thought it would be interesting to create an applications in React and have it availble within Liferay DXP.

  For this project, we will take a look at:
  1. Creating new React applications and deploying them to Liferay DXP
  2. Deploying existing React applications to Liferay DXP
