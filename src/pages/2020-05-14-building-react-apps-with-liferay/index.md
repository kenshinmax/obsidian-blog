  For sometime now, I have been facinated with modern Javascript frameworks, especially React.

 In addition, I started working with Liferay DXP (Digital Experience Platform) to provide the Headless CMS capabilities.  So naturally, I thought it would be interesting to create an application in React and have it availble within Liferay DXP.

  For this project, we will take a look at:
  1. Creating new React applications and deploying them to Liferay DXP
  2. Deploying existing React applications to Liferay DXP
